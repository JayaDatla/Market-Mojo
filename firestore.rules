/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the financial news sentiment analyzer application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to financial news sentiment data while restricting write access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All sentiment analysis records are stored under the `/artifacts/{appId}/public/data/financial_news_sentiment/{sentimentId}` path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access (`get`, `list`) is allowed for all sentiment records.
 * - Write access (`create`, `update`, `delete`) is restricted and requires authentication and `appId` match.
 * - The rules do NOT enforce a rigid schema but ensure the `appId` matches the path.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `appId` is part of the document path and can be used for authorization without requiring additional `get()` calls.

     * @allow (create) - An authenticated user can create a sentiment record if the `appId` in the path matches a field in the data.
     * @allow (update, delete) - Not allowed.
     * @deny (create) - An unauthenticated user cannot create a sentiment record.
     * @deny (create) - An authenticated user cannot create a sentiment record if the `appId` in the path does not match a field in the data.
     * @principle Allows public read access while restricting write access to authenticated users.
