    "reasoning": "Given the requirement for a global financial news sentiment analyzer and the emphasis on cost control, real-time updates, and static industry analysis, I recommend a relatively flat data structure that prioritizes efficient querying and security. The core data, sentiment analysis records, are stored in a public collection under an application identifier to prevent collisions and enable global access. The absence of user-specific data or private content simplifies the security model, eliminating the need for complex ownership or membership-based access controls. This structure achieves Authorization Independence because there is no reliance on parent document data for authorization. It supports the required QAPs by segregating all sentiment data into a single collection with uniform access requirements, enabling secure list operations without the need for filtering based on user roles or ownership."
